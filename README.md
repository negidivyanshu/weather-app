Project Title: Weather Dashboard

Description:
This Weather Dashboard is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather in a specific city. Users can enter the city name, select the desired temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) from a dropdown menu, and then either click the "Search" button or press "Enter" to retrieve the weather information.

How to Use:

Enter the name of the city you want to check in the "Enter city name" input field.
Select the temperature unit you prefer (Celsius or Fahrenheit) from the dropdown menu labeled "Temperature Unit."
You can either click the "Search" button or press the "Enter" key on your keyboard to retrieve weather information for the specified city.
The weather information will be displayed below, including the temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.
Important Note:
To use this Weather Dashboard, you need to replace the placeholder apiKey with your own WeatherAPI API key to access weather data.

Technical Details:

The application uses the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data.
JavaScript is used to handle user input, make API requests, and update the user interface.
The code allows for easy conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user preferences.
Users can initiate the search by clicking the "Search" button or pressing "Enter" in the city input field.
